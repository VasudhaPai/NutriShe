        <h3>Why Women’s Nutrition Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Women’s nutritional requirements change with age, lifestyle, and health
          conditions. Factors such as hormonal changes, iron and calcium needs,
          and conditions like PCOS or anemia play an important role in shaping
          dietary requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          NutriShe focuses on providing nutrition guidance that is practical,
          easy to follow, and aligned with everyday lifestyles.
